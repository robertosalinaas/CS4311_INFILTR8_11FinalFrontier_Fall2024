# INFILTR8 - Intelligent Network Findings with In-Depth Learning for Targeted Reconnaissance

## What is INFILTR8??
INFILTR8 is a cybersecurity tool designed to facilitate and expedite penetration testing for analysts working within the Cyber Experimentation & Analysis Division (CEAD). The system leverages machine learning (ML) to analyze reconnaissance files and generate a prioritized list of entry points for penetration testing.


##  System Requirements:
- *Operating System*: Kali Linux
- *Hardware*: Minimum of 4GB RAM, 4-core 2.5GHz CPU, 20GB available storage
- *Software*: Chrome or Firefox

## Frameworks and Libraries Used
- **Svelte**: A modern framework for building user interfaces.
- **SvelteKit**: Framework for building Svelte applications with routing and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety in JavaScript.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **PostCSS**: Tool for transforming CSS with plugins.
- **Autoprefixer**: Adds vendor prefixes for better browser compatibility.
